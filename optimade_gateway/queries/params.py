    """URL query parameters for `GET /search`

    This is an extension of the
    [`EntryListingQueryParams`](https://www.optimade.org/optimade-python-tools/api_reference/server/query_params/#optimade.server.query_params.EntryListingQueryParams)
    class in `optimadeÂ´, which defines the standard entry listing endpoint query
    parameters.

    The extra query parameters are as follows.

    Attributes:
        database_ids (Set[str]): List of possible database IDs that are already known by
            the gateway. To be known they need to be registered with the gateway
            (currently not possible).

        optimade_urls (Set[AnyUrl]): A list of OPTIMADE base URLs. If a versioned base
            URL is supplied it will be used as is, as long as it represents a supported
            version. If an un-versioned base URL, standard version negotiation will be
            conducted to get the versioned base URL, which will be used as long as it
            represents a supported version.

            **Example**: `http://example.org/optimade/v1/search?optimade_urls="https://example.org/optimade_db/v1","https://optimade.herokuapp.com"`

        endpoint (str): The entry endpoint queried. According to the OPTIMADE
            specification, this is the same as the resource's type.

            **Example**: `structures`

        timeout (int): Timeout time (in seconds) to wait for a query to finish before
            redirecting (*after* starting the query). Note, if the query has not finished
            after the timeout time, a redirection will still be performed, but to a
            zero-results page, which can be refreshed to get the finished query (once it
            has finished).

        as_optimade (bool): Return the response as a standard OPTIMADE entry listing
            endpoint response. Otherwise, the response will be based on the
            [`QueriesResponseSingle`][optimade_gateway.models.responses.QueriesResponseSingle]
            model.
